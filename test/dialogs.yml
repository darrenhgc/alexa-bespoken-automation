      Arrange a glucose tolerance test
      Positive values
      Glucose mmol/l
      Fasting > 5.1
      1 hour > 10.0
      2 hour > 8.5
      Refer to JR diabetes service if positive

      Check Random glucose.
      • If > 11.1 mmol/l diagnose diabetes
      • If <11.1 mmol/l and symptoms for > 2 months
      an HbA1c can be checked.
      • If HbA1c > 48 mmol/l (6.5%) this suggests
      diabetes. Repeat to confirm.
      • If <48 mmol/l (6.5%) seek alternative
      explanation for symptoms.
      • If random glucose <11.1 mmol/l and symptoms
      for <2 months options are as in box for no
      symptoms

      Check fasting blood glucose or HbA1c
      • Fasting glucose > 7.0 mmol/l suggests
      diabetes. Repeat to confirm
      • HbA1c > 48mmol/l (6.5%) suggests
      diabetes. Repeat to confirm
